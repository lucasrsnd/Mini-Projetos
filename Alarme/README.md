# Alarm

<p>The project is a minimalist alarm app that allows users to easily set the desired alarm time. With an intuitive interface, the user can enter the exact time they want the alarm to go off. The system is then programmed to alert the user when the set time has been reached. When activated, the alarm will emit a clear and distinct sound to notify the user of the scheduled time. Full of basic and efficient features, the project was developed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring a direct and uncomplicated experience for users.</p>

## Aplication
The project offers a user-friendly interface with two separate fields, one for entering the desired time and another for configuring the minutes. Next to these fields there is a “Add alert” button. By clicking this button, the user can confirm the alarm configuration and activate it by selecting the “Activate alarm” option. Additionally, a “Clear” option is provided next to each added alert, allowing users to delete identified alerts if necessary.
When the hour and minutes set for the alarm match the current time, the alarm will automatically emit a distinct beep to alert the user of the event. This feature is designed to provide a convenient and reliable way to manage reminders and appointments, ensuring users can keep track of their schedules efficiently and without hassle.
